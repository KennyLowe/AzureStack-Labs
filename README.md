# Azure Stack Labs

### Overview

Azure Stack allows you to bring the fast-paced innovations of cloud computing to your on-premise environment. In this lab, you'll explore how you can use Azure to prototype for Azure Stack. You'll use the policy module and Azure to simulate an Azure Stack environment, and then you'll use the template validator to ensure Azure Resource Manager templates are Azure Stack ready.

### Objectives

- Understand Azure Resource Manager templates and versioning.
- Use Azure Resource Manager version profiles to install PowerShell
- Create an Azure resource group and deploy and Azure Resource Manager template.
- Use the Azure Stack Policy module to constrain the resource group.
- Test the limits of the constrained resource group.
- Use the Azure Stack template validator to identify versioning incompatibilities
- Update the template for Azure Stack.

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 with the Azure PowerShell module installed
- Azure subscription (Sign up for a free account here. Needs a Microsoft account)
